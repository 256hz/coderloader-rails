    title:"Front End Dev / Product Designer",
    bio:'Before coding, I was a hardware designer, startup founder, and sound engineer. In sound, I learned technical problem solving; in startups, I learned business logic. As a product designer, I learned creative problem solving from many perspectives: the user’s, the owner’s, and the manufacturer’s. Clear, concise communication was always paramount. Software design lets me combine all my experience, so moving to development was a no-brainer for me! I can finally make deep functionality feel light and effortless. I graduated from the Flatiron Full Stack Web Development program in June 2019, and my goal is to be a Technical Lead in the next 3-5 years.',
